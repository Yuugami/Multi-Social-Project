Social Universal Site (Placeholder)

Welcome to our site.

Our goal here is to create a site which combines all other sites together. Upon opening the index page, you will be greeted with four sections. The first 3 sections will have a name of a social site in the center. Section 1 will have Facebook, Section 2 will have Twitter and Section 3 will have Instagram. The idea is that each section will generate the site with respect to the name in the middle. This means that Section 1 will load Facebook and users will be able to interact with facebook in that section. You'll notice that Section 1 is twice the size of Section 2 and 3. We believe that there is a main social site for all users and that site should generate in the bigger section. Anything in the smaller section will only generate a portion of the site (News Feed for example). Swapping spots is possible.

What if you want to use Pinterest instead of Instagram? LinkedIn instead of Facebook? Google+ instead of Twitter? Simple. Hover your mouse to the left center of the screen and a few arrows should appear. Click and a "Social Cabinet" will open up with blocks inside of them. Each block contains the name of a social site. Click and drag a block outside of the cabinet and drop it on the section of your choice. The magic will take place and LinkedIn will replace Facebook. Don't worry. Facebook is safe. When you re-open the cabinet, Facebook will show up in the same spot LinkedIn was.

Login and Register features are available for extra services that provide easier navigation and usage of the site (such as login into all sites of your choices instead of logging in one by one).
